Features marked with * are not or only partially implemented.

+ Speedy 
You have a constant higher speed!
Your physics are a bit slipperier, though. You fall faster, but you also jump slightly higher.

+ Climbing
You can climb up a few blocks to help you leap the gap!
On poles (fences, walls, iron bars, end rods, etc) this meter does not go down.

+ Pounce
Stand still and sneak to charge up a BIG jump!

+ Spear (ACTIVE, REQUIRES STICKS)
Launch a spear that deals damage and pins down whatever it hits!

- Small and Fragile
You are a bit over one block tall- and you only have six hearts!

- Rain World
Fear the rain. You take damage in rain (1 heart/2 points per second) and your vision is heavily obscured. Regular water does not affect you, though, just rain.

- Sheltered Sleep
You can only sleep with a roof over your head, and only if you're over 60% full.

- Fast Metabolism
You're hungrier than most players.

ARTIFICER
+ Explode on command after a short charge-up, or use this explosion to launch yourself forward!
+ Immune to explosions!
+ Creepers don't care about you!
+ Double jump with an explosion! (But be careful, or you might just explode yourself...)
+ Unarmed strikes deal more damage!
+ Spears explode after a short delay!
+ Craft TNT with ease!
- Explode on death in water (this deletes your items)
- Very little lung capacity, making you start drowning near instantly.
- Carnivorous
- Villagers will not trade with you, and Iron Constructs are hostile to you.
