Featuring: (*-marked features are planned/WIP)

+ High Jump*
There's a spring in your step- almost literally! You can jump one and a half blocks, or two and a half in a densely forested biome.

+ fast*
Nature aids your movement, and actively helps you move around! You move faster than most players.

+ Cushioned Fall
Nature does not want to hurt you- you take no fall damage.

+ Mask of the Wild*
When sneaking in a forest biome, you turn fully invisible!

+ Limited Flight
Take to the skies with your elven wings! They're not that strong, though, so they give out after a bit.

+ Arrow Ace
You know exactly how to use bows to your advantage! Arrows deal two more hearts of damage.

+ Infinity
If you hit a target with an arrow, it is automatically returned to you!

+ Long-Lived*
You have 15 hearts!

- Vegetarian
No meat for you :)

- Pacifist*
You're a bit hesitant to hurt things, dealing less meelee damage (to passives?). (Don't ask why bows and tridents are exempt from this)

- Ferrous Fiend*
Iron deals more damage to you, and you cannot wear Iron or Chainmail. Leather, Gold, Diamond and Netherite are fair game, though. 



+ probably more once i think of anything at all
ideas:
phasing through leaves
buffs the longer you haven't killed something
quicker draw speed for bows
if in range of an active jukebox get powerful regen & resistance? 
misty step? other magic? i could theoretically reuse the hypnosis effect from the vampire...

i need nerfs :/
