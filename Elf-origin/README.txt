Featuring: (*-marked features are planned/WIP)

+ High Jump
There's a spring in your step- almost literally! You can jump one and a half blocks, or two and a half in a densely forested biome.

+ Swift-Footed
Nature aids your movement, and actively helps you move around! You move faster than most players.

+ Cushioned Fall
Nature does not want to hurt you- you take no fall damage.

+ Mask of the Wild*
When sneaking in a forest biome, you turn fully invisible!

+ Wings
Your wings suck ass and don't let you actually fly. Enjoy elytra flight. (Does not render elytra specifically to let Ears mod enjoyers use their actual wings)

+ Arrow Ace
You know exactly how to use bows to your advantage! Arrows deal two more hearts of damage.

+ Infinity
If you hit a target with an arrow, it is automatically returned to you!

+ Long-Lived
You have 15 hearts!

- Vegetarian
No meat for you :)

- Pacifist*
You're hesitant to hurt things- your power wanes if you kill. (details below)

- Ferrous Fiend
Iron deals more damage to you, and you cannot wear Iron or Chainmail. Leather, Gold, Diamond and Netherite are fair game, though. 



+ probably more once i think of anything at all
ideas:
== nerfs if you kill stuff:
	- hostiles -10
	- sentient hostiles -15
	- neutral mobs (check json) -25
	- sentient neutrals (endermen, piglins) -35
	- passives -30
	- sentient passives & zillagers -40
	- bosses -70
	- players -100
	== nerfs are percentile-based
	- 100% no nerfs, regeneration
	- 90% no nerfs
	- 75% slowness I
	- 50% slowness II & weakness
	- 25% slowness II, weakness, mining fatigue
	- 10% nausea, slowness III, mining fatigue
	- 5% nausea, slowness IV, mining fatigue, wither, blindness, bad luck
	- 0% you just die lol bye

== if in range of an active jukebox get powerful regen & resistance? the question is what the range should be lol

other ideas:
phasing through leaves
misty step? other magic? i could theoretically reuse the hypnosis effect from the vampire...
quicker draw speed for bows (BIG maybe. like it fits thematically but sir your bow powers)
i need nerfs :/
