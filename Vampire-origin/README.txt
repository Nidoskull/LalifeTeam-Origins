This is Nidoskull's Vampire origin!
A simple, balanced origin that's ideal for those wishing for a nocturnal life.

Features the following traits and abilities:

+ (ACTIVATED) Blink
Blink and you'll miss it! Teleport up to 15 blocks away with your primary ability key, wherever you happen to be looking. (Ideal for precise changes in height while levitating!) Goes through water, collides with glass. Leaves a trail of particles behind on succesful teleport.
(1.17 version has an ender pearl instead due to changes in mod functionality.)

+ (TOGGLED) Levitation
Press your secondary key to toggle between regular physics, and maintaining your vertical height! Comes pre-equipped with a launch on cooldown.

+ Nightfall
Your predator abilities are strengthened in the dark. You gain Speed I, Haste I and Night Vision whenever you are not in the sun. 

+ Hypnosis
Sneak while looking at an entity to dramatically slow it and give it blindness! Effect does not last long, so escape is easy for players that can move around easily.

= Sanguivore
Regular food makes you sick- you must drink the blood of living creatures to survive... *Any* edible item's effectiveness is reduced by 80%, and gives you nausea. To eat, you must instead sneak and use (right-click) an entity. You cannot kill anything by feeding on them.

= Undead
Well, vampires are undead, aren't they? You are affected by Smite, and the reversal of damage/healing potions.

- Solar Weakness
The bright light of the sun is too much for you. Whenever you are directly in the sun, you receive a stacking debuff of up to 1 minute each of Slowness, Weakness and Mining Fatigue. This sucks bad and is not good. ;P

- Timber Splinters
Wooden weapons deal more damage to you. Compatible with the following mods: Campanion, Medieval Weapons
Please open an issue on GitHub or DM Nidoskull {&}#7295 on Discord for more mod compatibility! I'd be happy to help you out :)
Alternatively- wooden weapons are defined by data/vampire/tags/items/wooden_weapons.json. Add any weapon you'd like to this list to increase its damage against vampires by 3 points (1.5 hearts). 

- Unholy Visage
Villagers will not trade with you.

- Invite Only
You must be invited into spaces gated off by doors, fence gates or trapdoors. You also break these 80% slower, and breaking them will make a lot of noise. (You can still use redstone to circumvent this.)
