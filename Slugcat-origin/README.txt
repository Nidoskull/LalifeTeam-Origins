Features marked with * are not or only partially implemented.

+ Speedy 
You have a constant higher speed!

+ Climbing
You can climb up a few blocks to help you leap the gap!

+ Pounce*
Stand still and sneak to charge up a BIG jump!

+ Spear
Launch a spear that deals damage and pins down whatever it hits!

= Weird Physics?? (Name wip)
Your physics are a bit slipperier. You fall faster, but you also jump slightly higher.

- Small and Fragile
You are only one block tall- and you only have six hearts!

- Rain World
Fear the rain. You take damage in rain (2 points per second) and your vision is heavily obscured. Regular water does not affect you, though, just rain.

- Sheltered Sleep*
You can only sleep in confined spaces, and only if you're over 60% full.

- Fast Metabolism
You're hungrier than most players.

VOIDCAT*
