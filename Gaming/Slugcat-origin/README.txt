Features marked with * are not or only partially implemented.

+ Speedy 
You have a constant higher speed!
Your physics are a bit slipperier, though. You fall faster, but you also jump slightly higher.

+ Climbing
You can climb up a few blocks to help you leap the gap!
On poles (fences, walls, iron bars, end rods, etc) this meter does not go down.* (*not implemented yet)

+ Pounce
Stand still and sneak to charge up a BIG jump!

+ Spear (ACTIVE, REQUIRES STICKS)
Launch a spear that deals damage and pins down whatever it hits!

- Small and Fragile
You are a bit over one block tall- and you only have six hearts!

- Rain World
Fear the rain. You take damage in rain (1 heart/2 points per second) and your vision is heavily obscured. Regular water does not affect you, though, just rain.
Rain also comes more often.

- Sheltered Sleep
You can only sleep with a roof over your head, and only if you're over 60% full.

- Fast Metabolism
You're hungrier than most players.
