Features marked with * are not or only partially implemented.

+ Speedy 
You have a constant higher speed!
Your physics are a bit slipperier, though. You fall faster, but you also jump slightly higher.

+ Climbing
You can climb up a few blocks to help you leap the gap!
On poles (fences, walls, iron bars, end rods, etc) this meter does not go down.

+ Pounce
Stand still and sneak to charge up a BIG jump!

+ Spear (ACTIVE)
Launch a spear that deals damage and pins down whatever it hits!

- Small and Fragile
You are only one block tall- and you only have six hearts!

- Rain World
Fear the rain. You take damage in rain (1 heart/2 points per second) and your vision is heavily obscured. Regular water does not affect you, though, just rain.

- Sheltered Sleep
You can only sleep with a roof over your head, and only if you're over 60% full.

- Fast Metabolism
You're hungrier than most players.

+ Craft anywhere!*
+ Spit up items at the cost of food*
+ You can ground pound entities, dealing no fall damage to you!
= Your food determines your strength and speed.
= You're slightly fatter, but can still fit through most gaps with ease.
- You need even more food to sleep.
- Using tools exhausts you, slowing you down.
- You're more vulnerable to gravity than other slugcats. Being at less than 6 food points will eliminate this, though.
