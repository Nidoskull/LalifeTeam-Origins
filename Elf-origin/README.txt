+ High Jump
There's a spring in your step- almost literally! You can jump one and a half blocks, or two and a half in a densely forested biome.

+ Swift-Footed
Nature aids your movement, and actively helps you move around! You move faster than most players.

+ Cushioned Fall
Nature does not want to hurt you- you take no fall damage.

+ Mask of the Wild
When sneaking in a forest biome, you turn fully invisible!

+ Wings
Your wings suck ass and don't let you actually fly. Enjoy elytra flight. (Does not render elytra specifically to let Ears mod enjoyers use their actual wings)

+ Arrow Ace
You know exactly how to use bows to your advantage! Arrows deal two more hearts of damage.

+ Infinity
If you hit a target with an arrow, it is automatically returned to you!

+ Long-Lived
You have 15 hearts!

- Vegetarian
No meat for you :)

- Pacifist
You're hesitant to hurt things- your power wanes if you kill. (details below, compatibility list below)

- Ferrous Fiend
Iron deals more damage to you, and you cannot wear Iron or Chainmail. Leather, Gold, Diamond and Netherite are fair game, though.

Any mobs added by other mods will have a flat -25% penalty on kill.
